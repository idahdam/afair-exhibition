              I Architecture as a knowledge discipline and as a practice is
              constantly challenged to maintain its relevance to the dynamic of
              life. Ever since the pandemic in 2020, our life will never be the
              same. At Universitas Indonesia, we believe that the changes should
              be the trigger for shifting the direction of our architectural
              education and practice. It becomes an opportunity to rethink the
              ways of architecture and interior architecture design should be
              done.

              Design learning should move to the arena where the acts of
              designing are not limited to the conventional approaches of
              programming, developing spatial ideas, and representing. Various
              new concerns have emerged: New definition of spatial experience,
              new forms of relationship; new media, tools, and platforms, new
              limits and boundaries. Therefore, current design practice needs to
              incorporate more competences: predicting the unpredicted, working
              from afar, dealing with the virtual and intangible; reading the
              emerging data landscape; and manoeuvring within the complexity of
              everything that keeps changing.‚Äù
